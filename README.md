*Project Overview*

In this project, we aim to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based TTS converter in Python that operates offline. Unlike typical Python TTS converters that often require command-line interface (CLI) usage and an active internet connection, this offline, GUI-based solution offers a more user-friendly and accessible alternative.

*Key Components*

*Graphical User Interface (GUI):* The GUI will be built using Python libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt, providing users with an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.

*Offline Functionality:* The system will function without the need for an internet connection, ensuring accessibility at all times.

*Text-to-Speech Conversion:* Leveraging offline TTS libraries like pyttsx3, the system will convert text input by the user into speech.


Conclusion

This project will result in a robust, user-friendly offline text-to-speech converter using Python. By providing a GUI and eliminating the need for an internet connection, the tool will be accessible and practical for a wide range of users and applications.
